The general assumption is that there is a single building on a single property and that the EWRB ID is unique to a single building (not the lot upon which it sits); however, this is often unconfirmed and it is possible that building owners can report on multiple individual structures using a single EWRB ID. Conversely, when multiple individual buildings sit on a single lot (uniquely identified by an Assessment Roll Number), the province may assign a unique EWRB ID to each building and the owners may report on each building individually.

WN_Sit_Elc_Int1,Weather-normalized Site Electricity Intensity (GJ/m2),"The annual average electricity, measured in gigajoules, used per square meter at a building, provided by the reporter. These values are weather-normalized and not climate-normalized.","Portfolio Manager weather-normalizes data by using a 30-year average to determine annual consumption in an average year (even if the particular year in question was hotter or colder than average). This lets you accurately compare the performance of a building in different years. For more information on how Portfolio Manager weather-normalizes usage data, search the Frequently Asked Questions at https://portfoliomanager.zendesk.com. While whese values are weather-normalized, they are NOT climate-normalized. Observations from different climatic areas cannot be compared directly (for example, Sudbury is normally colder than Toronto regardless of annual weather variation and identical buildings hosting identical activities in these two locations would use different amounts of energy--a building in Sudbury would normally use more due to a higher winter heating load). 

Portfolio Manager does not weather-normalize energy use data for single reporting periods greater than 65 days.

""Site"" is used in contrast to ""Source"". 'Site' energy denotes the energy used right at a building, whereas 'Source' energy denotes total energy, including the energy used to create and deliver that site energy to a building. For example, a natural-gas-fired power plant burns natural gas to generate electricity and energy is lost in that conversion, then some electricity is lost as it is transmitted across wires from the generation site to a building. 'Source' energy includes all the energy contained in the natural gas and the energy lost during transmission. For a more detailed explanation, search the Frequently Asked Questions at https://portfoliomanager.zendesk.com.

To calculate intensity, Portfolio Manager uses a building's reported Gross Floor Area (GFA). For more information on which parts of a building are included and excluded in GFA, search the Frequently Asked Questions at https://portfoliomanager.zendesk.com.
